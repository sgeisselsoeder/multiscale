This project analyzes a set of directions on a sphere (originally developed for the directions of muon neutrinos in equatorial coordinates) to detect the most pronounced overdense region.

The input can be given as a text file, each line one position, with right ascension and declination.
The output is a skymap in Hammer-Aitov-projection and a p-value (and the significance) for each found overdense region a.k.a. cluster.
