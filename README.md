This project analyzes a set of directions on a sphere 
(originally developed for the directions of neutrinos in equatorial coordinates) 
to detect the most pronounced overdense region.

The input can be supplied as a text file, with each line encoding one position.
Each line contains right ascension, declination and, for historical reasons, four arbitrary numbers.
All values within a line are separated by whitespaces.

The output is a skymap in Hammer-Aitov-projection showing the evaluated densities,
skymaps visualizing found overdense regions (a.k.a clusters), as well as
p-values/significances for each found cluster.
